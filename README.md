## Introduction
This project focuses on using neural networks to perform market segmentation based on customer demographics, behavior, and other relevant factors. Market segmentation is a crucial task for businesses looking to tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to specific customer segments.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore and analyze customer data from the provided datasets. We leverage deep learning techniques to build a neural network model that can effectively segment markets.

## Datasets
We utilize two main datasets for this project:
- [Bank Marketing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing)
- [Online Retail Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved neural network models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building the model, we perform EDA to gain insights into the data. We analyze feature correlations, handle missing values, and identify potential outliers.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves data cleaning, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and handling outliers. This step ensures that the data is suitable for training the neural network.

## Building the Neural Network Model
We create a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture is designed to perform market segmentation based on the data.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate metrics. Training and validation results are recorded and analyzed.

## Future Work
In future iterations of this project, we can explore additional datasets, fine-tune the model, and further improve segmentation accuracy.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to show the analysis.
